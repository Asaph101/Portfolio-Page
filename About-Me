My 'why?' I chose MPFT9: 

The reason is that I've always wanted to be able to write codes and especially hack.But also MPFT9 equips me with the ability to make a website which is an added skill in the Tech industry.So the main reason for me would be to have some info' on using the command line and later on to go through the Cyber Security course.
